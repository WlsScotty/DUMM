Dynamic Universal Memory Manipulator (DUMM) is a simple cross-operating system library that allows for baseline memory manipulation.

It is intended to be used across operating systems. It has low level capabilities, and is meant to be used in heap allocations of reading and writing memory.
IT IS NOT CURRENTLY TESTED FOR MULTITHREADING, WOULD NOT RECCOMDEND.

Since the actual header is >120 lines, and has useful comments, I wont really put much documentation for it.
