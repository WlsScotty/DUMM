Dynamic Universal Memory Manipulator (DUMM) is a simple cross-operating system library that allows for baseline memory manipulation.

It is intended to be used across operating systems. It has low level capabilities, and is meant to be used in heap allocations of reading and writing memory.
IT IS NOT CURRENTLY TESTED FOR MULTITHREADING.

Since the actual header is >130 lines, and has useful comments, I wont really put much documentation for it.

Still on its alpha phase, windows hasn't been implemented yet.
